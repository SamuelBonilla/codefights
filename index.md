## {{ page.title }}

Codefights is, among other things, a platform where you can practice, learn and improve your programming skills (either by programming with different languages, by learning/practicing different mathematical algorithms...). So, it provides you:


* Fun and addicting. You can see the problems like games.
* Mental agility and implementation speed. It can help you to do better your work, your contests or simply, yourself as programmer.
* Learn new languages. A funny way to become familiar with a new language.
* Learn with other people's solutions once you have implemented your solution.
